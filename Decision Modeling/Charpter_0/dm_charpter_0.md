# Introduction to Decision Modeling

## Models

### What is a model?

Model is a simplified representation of a system or phenomenon

*⇒* Representation of reality

More Precisely: A model refers to some form of symbolic representation of

our assumptions about reality



### Why do we use models?

Enhance our understanding of the world to improve our decision making

Elaborate a scientific method to solve a problem

​	Duplicable (repeatable)

​	Reduce bias



### Types of models

Deterministic models

​	outcomes are precisely determined through known relationships among states and events

​	in such models, a given input will always produce the same output

​	Ex: Resources to make a PC are the same every time

​	Domains: Multi-Attribute Decision Making; Linear programing; . . .

And Probabilistic (stochastic) models



### Models are fed by data

Qualitative data

​	measured by quality

​	Expert opinions

​	Ex: class atmosphere, . . .

Quantitative data

​	Easily measured by numbers

​	Ex: Numbers of tv programs a day; number of applications in a phone; . . .



### Formal models vs Informal models

Formal models are usually stated via mathematics, often equations.

Formal models give replicable results. This is the simple meaning of “mathematical proof”.









## Decision theory and Decision analysis

Decision: A **choice** that you make about something after thinking about several possibilities

### What is a “good decision”?

Good for whom, according to what criteria, at which moment in time?



### Decision Analysis

Definition (B. Roy): “consists in trying to provide *answers* to questions raised by actors involved in a *decision process* using a *model*”





## Main steps of developing a decision model

### *Developing a decision model (Step 1)*

Formulation: Translate the problem scenario into a mathematical model

Define the problem

Develop a decision model

​	Variables: Measurable quantity that can be variable

​	Parameters: measurable quantity inherent to problem



### *Developing a decision model (Step 2)*

Solution: Mathematical expressions from formulation are solved

Develop a Solution: Manipulate model to arrive at the best solution. Ex: Time=Distance/Rate

Test Solution: Does the solution make sense?



### *Developing a decision model (Step 3)*

Interpretation: Implication of results

**Conduct sensitivity analysis**:

​	what happens if parameters vary?

​	Testing outcomes under a variety of states

**Implement results**: Enact solution & monitor it performs as expected



### *Possible problems*

**Defining the problem**: Conflicting viewpoints, impact on other stakeholders

**Model development**: Fitting problem scenario to textbook model, understanding of others

**Acquiring data**: Existence, validity

**Developing a solution**: Limitations of one answer

**Implementation**: Management and user support







## Decision’s algorithm & Transparency

Decisions made by algorithms can be opaque because of technical and social reasons, in addition to being made purposely opaque to protect intellectual property.

For example, the algorithms may be too complex to explain or efforts to explain the algorithms might require the use of data that violates a country’s privacy regulations.



### *An algorithm : Definition*

An algorithm is a sequence of instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation.

An algorithm has to be

Finite: The algorithm must eventually solve the problem;

Well-defined: The series of steps must be precise and present steps that are understandable;

Effective: An algorithm must solve all cases of the problem for which someone defined it.



### *Transparency*

Algorithmic transparency is the principle that the factors that influence the decisions made by algorithms should be visible, or transparent, to the people who use, regulate, and are affected by systems that employ those algorithms.

Algorithmic transparency is openness about the purpose, structure and underlying actions of the algorithms used to search for, process and deliver information.

Two important properties

**Explanation**: Systems and institutions that use algorithmic decision-making are encouraged to produce explanations regarding both the procedures followed by the algorithm and the specific decisions that are made. This is particularly important in public policy contexts

**Accountability**: Institutions should be held responsible for decisions made by the algorithms that they use, even if it is not feasible to explain in detail how the algorithms produce their results.
